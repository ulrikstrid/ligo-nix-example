# Tests

## Usage

Run `make test`

## Code Style

- End-to-end tests and helpers should only import the contract under test "main"
  file, keeping this convention allows for easier refactoring.
- End-to-end tests are separated by entry points, this allows to bootstrap
  desired storage state specifically, and is lowering cognitive load when
  focusing on a test (which usually only consists in calling only one entry point
  at a time).  
  As a result, each test file is named after the entry point under test:
  `one_of_parameter.test.mligo`.
- Test environment is bootstrapped at the beginning of each end-to-end test, or
  test suite, because sharing environment between tests or test suites can lead
  to higher cognitive load.
- Names of the end-to-end tests functions follow a convention, they should either
  begin with `test_success` when the test is expected to be successful or
  `test_failure` when the test is expected to return a `failwith` error.  
  Additionally, tested failures should be named after the tested error,
  as an example: `test_failure_not_owner`.

## Development Tips

A way to have some TDD experience is to use [`entr`](https://github.com/eradman/entr)
(or any other watcher) and export a `SUITE` variable when calling `test` target,
as an example:

```sh
fd -g "**/*.mligo" . | entr make test SUITE=propose
```
